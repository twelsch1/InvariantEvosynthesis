# InvariantEvosynthesis
This is a library for invariant synthesis that uses Genetic Programming, ICE Learning and Divide and Conquer. It achieves
state-of-the-art results on the Code2Inv benchmarks.

This library is in progress and will be cleaned up with better documentation and a guide on usage
coming in due course.
